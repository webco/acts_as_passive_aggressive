## How to use it ##

So now, you're probably thinking "How can I use this awesome plugin". Ok, then. *shesh*

Well, first this is a Rails plugin, so you'll have to install it just like any other plugin. Now, shall we do a thought experiment? Ok, let's pretend that, despite the fact that you're looking at a Rails plugin, you still don't have the slightest clue on how to do it.

First, you run `script/plugin install git://github.com/webco/act_as_passive_aggressive.git`, in your application root.

Cleared the first step? Still following? Then don't. We're through here.

## Running from command line ##

Open irb and enter:

`puts "act_as_passive_aggressive is a Rails plugin and don't run on command line "*10000`

Read the output aloud. Repeat until you reach perfect enlightenment.

## Justifying the plugin ##

Contrary to popular thought, recent psychological research has shown that passive aggression can actually be a healthy alternative to aggressive aggression.

If you're feeling slighted, it can be a happy medium between letting the issue go but feeling resentful and making your feelings known during a screaming match. If you're used to engaging in healthy interpersonal relations, this plugin is for you.
